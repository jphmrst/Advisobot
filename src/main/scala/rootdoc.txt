Advisobot generates human-readable, compact reports about a student's
progress through their university requirements, including majors,
minors, and various other requirements.

 - Package [[advisobot.core]] contains central, program-independent
   artifacts:

    - Class [[advisobot.core.Program Program]] details a component
      of a course of study: a major, minor, or set of other
      requirements.
   
    - Class [[advisobot.core.Course Course]] models one class.
   
    - Trait [[advisobot.core.Requirement Requirement]] is used to
      describe the elements of a [[advisobot.core.Program Program]].
   
    - Class [[advisobot.core.ScheduleSuggestion ScheduleSuggestion]] is
      the general type of object which can be included in future
      semester plans.  It contains two elements:

       1. A
          [[advisobot.core.CourseSelection description of the suggestion]],
 	  which, like a [[advisobot.core.Requirement Requirement]],
 	  can take one of several forms:
	  
     	   - Class [[advisobot.builder.AllSatisfying AllSatisfying]]

  	   - [[advisobot.builder.WithConditions WithConditions]]
	   
  	   - [[advisobot.core.Complete Complete]]
	   
 	   - [[advisobot.core.CoursePredicate CoursePredicate]]
	   
 	   - [[advisobot.core.Require Require]]
	   
 	   - [[advisobot.core.Select Select]]
	   
       1. A range of units.

    - Abstract class [[advisobot.core.Advisees Advisees]] should be
      extended as a {@code Main} class by each advisor, and populated
      with their advisees' information.

   objects, and methods for modeling programs and people.  Some are
   linked above, and this package also includes:
